# Super-Store-Sales

**Situation:**

I analyzed the sales data for a superstore. The dataset included over 5,000 entries with columns such as Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Profit, Returns, Payment Mode, and two additional indicators (ind1, ind2). The primary objective was to identify key performance indicators **(KPIs)**, perform thorough **data cleaning, and create visualizations** and **dashboards** to provide actionable insights into sales performance.

**Action:**

**Data Cleaning:**

**Removed Blank Columns:** Eliminated any columns that were entirely blank to streamline the dataset.

**Handled NaN Values: **Addressed missing values by either removing rows with NaNs or imputing them based on the context.

**Key Performance Indicators:** Identified relevant KPIs such as total sales by region, demand for construction-related commodities, payment preferences, sales trends, profit trends, shipping mode preferences, sales by category, and most sold items.
